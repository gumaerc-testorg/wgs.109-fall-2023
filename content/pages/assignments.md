## Papers

A choice of topics will be distributed 1–2 weeks in advance of the due date for the first two papers. The final paper will be on a theme of your choice, based on the issues discussed in the course and on personal research from the required and additional readings. Please free to discuss your ideas with me. It is expected all your papers will demonstrate understanding of the key ideas and themes of the readings. Arguments made in the papers should be supported by citations from relevant readings. 

NOTE: Students must submit papers on time. Late submissions, without prior notice, will result in a lowering of grades. Students should familiarize themselves with the Student Code of the University, particularly the sections on academic dishonesty and plagiarism. Plagiarism, which is the unacknowledged use of someone else's ideas and work on a paper, will result in an F grade.

Please make sure that your papers are your own work and that you are meticulous in quoting from the work of others and citing sources. You may seek advice from the Writing and Communication Center.

Paper 1 is due in week 5.    
Paper 2 is due in week 9.    
Paper 3 is due at the last day of class.  

## Oral Presentation

Each student will do one oral presentation during the last week of the semester. The presentation will be on their final paper. Students should plan to consult the instructor as well as the syllabus in planning their research topic. Oral presentations should be no longer than about 15–20 minutes.
