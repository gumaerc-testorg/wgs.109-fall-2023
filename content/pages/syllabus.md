## Course Meeting Times

Seminar: 2 sessions/week, 1.5 hours/session 

## Prerequisites

There are no prerequisites for this course.

## Course Requirements

### Criteria for Communications Intensive Subjects

Since this is a [Communications Intensive](https://registrar.mit.edu/registration-academics/academic-requirements/communication-requirement) course, it must meet the following mechanical criteria. This includes at least 20 pages of writing divided among 3–5 assignments. Of these assignments, at least one must be revised and resubmitted. The course should further offer students substantial opportunity for oral expression, through presentations, student-led discussion, or class.

### Evaluation

- Attendance and class participation: 15%
- Response papers (4, 1–2 pages each): 20%
- One oral presentation (10 minutes):  15%
- Two papers (6–7 pages): 15% each (Second paper to be rewritten and submitted in two weeks' time.)
- One final paper (7–8 pages): 20%

This is a discussion seminar, not a lecture course. Regular attendance and class participation are therefore critical. Attendance in class is mandatory. Absence from class without legitimate reason (and, ideally, prior notice) will adversely affect your grade. Missing two weeks of class will cause you to fail the course. Please be sure to read all the required readings for the class in advance and come prepared to participate in class discussion.

Four response papers to readings, talks, and films (1–2 pages each) will be turned in.
